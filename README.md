[DEPRECATED] go-libp2p-interface-conn
=====================================

This package has been deprecated and is no loner used by go-libp2p. Libp2p used
to build up connections as follows:

1. go "net" conn
2. multiaddr conn -- net conn with multiaddrs
3. go-libp2p-transport conn -- multiaddr conns with associated transports
4. this package -- secured, multiplexed connections
5. go-libp2p-net conn -- connections associated with a Network (e.g., go-libp2p-swarm).

However, go-libp2p-transport connections are now fully secured and multiplexed
so the interfaces in this package have been subsumed by those in
go-libp2p-transport.
